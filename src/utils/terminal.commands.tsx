        Am open-source chip-8 emulator written in Rust. 
        The project worked as very cool introduction to low-level programming and to more "Real" Rust projects.
        It supports pretty much every standard CHIP-8 ROM and Save States; Rewind support is still a work in progress.
        The project was also a good introduction to reverse engineering, since most of the "leaning" material is conformed 
        of technical documents.`

        A small open-source scripting language. The language initially started as an implementation of the Lox Programming language
        and eventually became a superset of said language. It is entirely written in C#, doesn't use any dependencies and it's
        just a tree-walk interpreter at its core. The language has support for variables, functions, function expressions, lists, classes,
        modules, pipe-operator, native modules (for handling files, strings, lists, maths), result-like structures, bitwise operations and
        many more things.
